# FPCNN
FINCH Predictive Coder Neural Network.

A full end-to-end implementation of the [CSNN](https://www.mdpi.com/2313-433X/6/6/38) state-of-the-art compression algorithm for hyperspectral image data. Developed by the [University of Toronto Aerospace Team](https://www.utat.ca/space-systems) :milky_way:.

# Usage
Check out the interactive Google Colab [notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DM1122/fpcnn) to start tinkering.

# Contribution
## Setup
This section will take you through the procedure to configure a development environment for FPCNN. If you just want to play around with FPCNN, see the interactive [notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DM1122/fpcnn) on Google Colab.

This repo employs [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as its dependency and environment manager. Poetry can be installed through the commandline via:
```
$ (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py -UseBasicParsing).Content | python -
```

Clone the repo using github desktop or the commandline via:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/DM1122/fpcnn
```

From within the cloned repo, run poetry's install command to install all the depencies in one go:
```
$ poetry install
```

Enter the generated virtual environment via:
```
$ poetry shell
```
Ensure you are always interacting with the development environment through the shell. You're now ready to start contributing!

## Commits
### Pre-Commit
This repo is configured to use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks. The pre-commit pipeline is as follows:

1. [Isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/): Sorts imports, so you don't have to.
1. [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): The uncompromising code autoformatter.
1. [Flakehell](https://flakehell.readthedocs.io/): Itâ€™s a Flake8 wrapper to make it cool (a linter).

A successful commit therefore requires satisfying the syntactic rules put forth by isort, black, and flakehell. Pre-commit will run the hooks on commit, but when a hook fails, they can be run manually to debug using:

```
$ isort . & black . & flakehell lint
```

### The 5 Rules of A Great Git Commit Message
<p align="center"><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git_commit.png" width="256"></p>

1. Write in the imperative
1. Capitalize first letter in the subject line 
1. Describe what was done and why, but not how
1. Limit subject line to 50 characters
1. End without a period

# Testing

This repo uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/) for unit testing. To run unit tests, call:

```
$ pytest
```

You can find an interactive report of test results in `./logs/pytest-report.html`.

# TODO
* Implement batch processsing
* Improve plotting utilities
